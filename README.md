Motivation

As anyone in the search for future employment opportunities, I wanted a simple and polished portfolio where you can see info about myself as a web developer. In addition, a description and link to my personal github hosting all my projects. A slider showcasing my three favorite projects I created which are mobile friendly. A section about a hobby I have outside of web development. And at the bottom of the page I have my phone number, Linkdn, github and email. A simple and easy all in one application where you can get to know me all around as a web developer. Feel free to reach out and say hello!
