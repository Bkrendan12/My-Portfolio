# Daily-Schedule-planner

Project title

Work-Day-Scheduler

Motivation

I wanted to make a scheduling application that would serve as a day-to-day planner where you can set and forget a daily routine from 9am to 5am. Giving the user
the flexibilty to change either hour with a new task or event seems extremely useful and there isnt too much else to it. I use it myself and love it, so maybe you will too.

Tech/framework used

This webpage was created using basic html, css, Javascript, moment() and jQuery.

Built with

--index.html --style.css --script.js --jQuery

How to use?

This is a simple day planner for anyone.

When you open the application, you will see the title and a clock displaying the current time from the year, down to the counting seconds.

Next, you will see a single container with hour blocks from 9am to 5pm, which is a typical full work day.

You are able to click on each text block and enter in your event or plan for that specific hour and save it with the button to the right of each hour block.

If you close out of the day planner and reopen it, you wont lose any information, which is my favorite part of the application.

Desired additions: I'd like to add a more visually pleasing style to the page, but for a basic day-to-day planner, it's extremely clean and useful.
