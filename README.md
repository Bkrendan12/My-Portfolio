Motivation

As anyone in the search of future employment opportunities, I wanted a simple and polished
portfolio application where you can see info about myself as a web developer. In addition, a description and link to my personal github hosting all my projects. A slider showcasing my three favorite projects I created which are mobile friendly. A section about a hobby I have outside
of web development. at the bottom of the page I have my phone number, Linkdn, github and email.
